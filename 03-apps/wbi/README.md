# Full extent WBI Shiny App

A {golem} project (i.e., an R package) containing the logic needed to run the WBI NWT Shiny app.

## What is {golem}?

> "[{golem}](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) is an opinionated framework for building production-grade shiny applications" - Colin Fay, package author

{golem} approaches building Shiny apps as *R packages*. There are several benefits of this approach, including:

* enforcement of *roxygen* documentation
* separation of business logic from app logic
* definition of package dependencies

For further reading into {golem} and building production-grade shiny applications, we recommend checking out the accompanying book, [*Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps*](https://engineering-shiny.org/).

## How to Use This App

Make sure you are running any app-related scripts within the [`app.Rproj` file](app.Rproj) project file (this will open the project in RStudio and set the work directory), or `cd 03-apps/wbi` into this folder. To test run the app, run the [`dev/run_dev.R`](dev/run_dev.R) script.

## Structure

The structure of this Shiny app / R package can be described as follows:

* [`data/`](data/) contains the datasets included with the package
* [`data-raw/`](data-raw/) contains the raw data & scripts used to generate the package data in [`data/`](data/)
* [`dev/`](dev/) contains helper scripts that you may find useful as you develop a {golem} app; they are not dependencies for the app and can be removed if desired
  + in particular, the [`dev/run_dev.R`] script is useful for running the app for testing purposes
* [`inst/`](inst/) contains mostly non-R styling & configuration components (e.g., CSS stylesheets, javascript helpers, favicon, etc.)
* [`man/`](man/) contains the roxygen-generated documentation; for the purposes of keeping the size of this package small, we currently did not generate **.Rd** files for any of the custom functions we developed in the [`R/`](R/) folder (we prevented this through the use of the `@noRd` tag in the roxygen headers for each function)
* [`R/`](R/) contains all of the app logic and business logic used in the app
  + [`app_ui.R`](R/app_ui.R) and [`app_server.R`](R/app_server.R) contain the overall UI & Server code that house the individual shiny modules
  + [`fct_map.R`](R/fct_map.R) contains the custom functions that generate the map visuals in the app (on the "Map" and "Side-by-Side" pages of the app)
  + [`fct_stats.R`](R/fct_stats.R) contains the custom functions that generate the map & table visuals on the "Regions" page
  + [`fct_download.R`](R/fct_download.R) contains the function that generates the table visual on the "Download" page
  + the `mod_*.R` scripts contain the modularized UI & Server components for each page in the app
  + [`run_app.R`](R/run_app.R) contains the function that renders the app; this script should not need to be modified
  + [`app_config.R`](R/app_config.R) contains low-level app configuration functions; this script should not need to be modified

## Docker

The `Dockerfile` is generated by the {golem} package, then extensively edited by hand. We use this to build a Docker image (change the tag as needed):

```bash
cd 03-apps/wbi

export TAG="ghcr.io/predictiveecology/wbi_shiny/shiny-wbi:v1"
docker build -t $TAG .
```

Test the app locally:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 $TAG
```

Now open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

Push to the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`): 

```bash
docker login ghcr.io

docker push $TAG
```

## Updating data in the app

### Lookup tables

1. Edit the `03-apps/wbi/data-raw/element-lookup.csv` file and save the changes.
2. Run the `03-apps/wbi/data-raw/data.R` script, this will update the `03-apps/wbi/data/*.rda` files.

### Regional summaries

Follow the comments in the `02-data-proc/wbi/07-regional-summaries.R` script.
